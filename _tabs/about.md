`Rick`: Hmm... where am I?

`Morty`: You know, Rick, I think we’re on the About page.

**_Hey there! I’m Yusuf, also known as `T3chnocr4tX` in the online world.
I’m a guy—honestly, I don’t really know much about myself. I think I’m a bit weird; I just find myself... oh no, let’s leave that aside._**

Okay, I’m just a guy who stares at his computer screen at night (just staring, haha).
Aside from staring at my computer, I’m also interested in security research, where I learn about vulnerabilities and look for them in web applications and APIs (application security) to help keep the internet safe.

I love learning new things and doing research when I have internet access on my PC, haha.

When I’m not busy in the digital world, you’ll find me watching basketball videos. I love basketball. To be honest, I’m also looking forward to learning how to play well in the future. My favorite player is Ja Morant.

Okay, that’s all—catch you later, guys.
